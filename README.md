# Vuepress-build-and-deploy
A GitHub Action to build and deploy Vuepress sites to GitHub Pages

This repository has been forked from @jenkey2011's [Vuepress deploy Github Action](https://github.com/jenkey2011/vuepress-deploy) to keep the code current and useful.
At the moment this is work in progress and not published at the [Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/) yet.    
To use the [Vuepress deploy Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vuepress-deploy) please refer to its current [README](https://github.com/jenkey2011/vuepress-deploy#).
